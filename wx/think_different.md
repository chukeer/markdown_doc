#Think Different
今天在优酷老友记看了乔布斯和比尔盖斯那一期，勾起了我无限回忆，当然主要是关于乔布斯，想起当初看《乔布斯传》的时候，真是觉得那是一场心灵上无比愉快的旅程，这个人被神化也被魔化了太多，我们没法看清他真实的样子，那就让我们看一下他主导的产品或事情吧，我想事物本身是不会欺骗人的。

今天推荐的是一则广告，是的，你没看错，这是苹果的一则广告，苹果为广告史贡献了两个最经典的广告，分别是在苹果公司创办初期和乔布斯重回苹果时，今天先看其中一则，1997年的Think Different，现在每次看仍旧让我热血沸腾，请在有WiFi的环境下点击。



	Here's to the crazy ones.
	The misfits.
	The rebels.
	The troublemakers.
	The round pegs in the square holes.
	The ones who see things differently.
	They're not fond of rules
	And they have no respect for the status quo.
	You can  quote them, disagree with them
	glorify or vilify them.
	About the only thing that you can't do is ignore them.
	Because they change things.
	They push the human race forward.
	While some may see them as the crazy ones, we see genius.
	Because the people who are crazy enough to think that they can change the world, are the ones who do.
